This directory contains a bunch of CSV files, consisting of sentence annotations from Amazon Mechanical Turk experiments. They also contain other experimental parameters, such as F-score and I-score (explained in paper), and the original sentences.

Recall that we had two MTurk experiments. Results from the first experiment are in the following files:

mturk_experiment_1.csv
mturk_experiment_1_blog_part.csv
mturk_experiment_1_forum_part.csv
mturk_experiment_1_news_part.csv


Results from the second experiment are in the following files:

mturk_experiment_2.csv
mturk_experiment_2_blog_part.csv
mturk_experiment_2_forum_part.csv
mturk_experiment_2_news_part.csv


Each CSV file has one sentence per line (i.e., per row), that is, one HIT per line.

The columns are as follows:

Sentence ID           =  A numeric ID assigned to sentences
HIT ID                =  MTurk HIT ID
Formality             =  Mean formality rating given by five Turkers
Informativeness       =  Mean informativeness rating given by five Turkers
Implicature           =  Mean implicature rating given by five Turkers
Length in Words       =  Length of the sentence in words
Length in Characters  =  Length of the sentence in characters
F-score               =  Heylighen and Dewaele's F-score (explained in paper)
I-score               =  Information score (explained in paper)
Lexical Density       =  Ure's Lexical density (explained in paper)
Sentence              =  The sentence itself
