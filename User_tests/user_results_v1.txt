I am Silke. I am 21 years old. I work for the UvA as a tutor for firstyear students. I hate doing the dishes, because it smells terrible and it is something I must do, and I hate things I must do. When I do sports I have fun, because during sports I clear my mind.
Thank you very much for telling me something about yourself! How can I help you today? => 40.625
